pearson_exotronics,FACTION,"A lesser known megacorporation hailing from the late domain era, Pearson Exotronics were generally thought to have been founded as a conglomerate representing the interests of a number of formerly colonial worlds that had the infrastructure and good luck to develop original and inspired designs in the field of spaceborne engineering and robotics. Although finding competition in larger organisations such as the Tri-Tachyon Corporation and Eridani-Utopia, Pearson Exotronics was able to expand its influence into a number of sectors throughout its local region of colonised space, offering cheap transportation, habitation and defence contracting thanks to a number of significant breakthroughs in sub-sentient automation.

Pre-collapse, the PEC invested in building and entrenching a promising, postcolonial world formerly administrated by Domain authorities, in the hope of gaining a foothold in the Persean sector through offering competing technologies to otherwise monopolised services. When the gates fell, local leadership was quick to implement protocols assuming total disconnection from higher corporate command, taking steps to ensure self-sustainability and security. In the years post-collapse, Pearson Exotronics has survived wars and famine through tough civil doctrine and compulsary military service, building the foundation for a tough naval core with domestically-trained officers and personnel. The geographical location of the Corporation's home system as a buffer to the Hegemony worlds led to the two factions acting as mutual allies during the AI wars, but have subsequently soured from predatory trade practices. The Independent worlds of the sector are the Corporation's biggest customers, trading convoy protection and men for advanced technologies from  ancient military catacombs.",,,
