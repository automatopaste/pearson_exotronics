PSE_corsair_mk1,WEAPON,"A derivative of the conventional Railgun, the Corsair mechanism delivers three bolts with moderate kinetic energy at medium range. The slug explosively deforms on hitting armour or hull, causing additional fragmentation damage.

The loading mechanism for this weapon is a simple but effective modification of the Railgun's, separating magazine and firing chamber with a unique three-pattern mini-zine. When the firing sequence is started, the primary magnetic field is quickly charged, while the slugs in ""limbo"", as nicknamed by gunnery technicians familiar with the design, are quickly elevated into the chamber, and ejected at speed.",Close Support,,
PSE_novaburst_mini,WEAPON,"A minituarized defensive flak system that fires unique Starburst-pattern shrapnel shells equipped with a proximity fuse for effectiveness against fighters and missiles.

The difficulty of scaling down of the conventional flak cannon required significant compromise of the standard warhead design. The unique Starburst type flak shell creates a surprising amount of fragmentation debris within its area of effect, while having a narrower calibre that this weapons system can fire with minimal wear and loss of accuracy.",Point Defense,,
PSE_spectrumpd,WEAPON,"A semi-modification of the venerable Burst PD system that installs additional disruptive beam components capable of stunning fighters, but losing effective armor penetration.

The disruption of the beam using dual secondary peaking oscillators, allows for the projection of exotic p-space particles, passively collected through natural ship movement, which cause unintended electrical behaviour in the flux management systems of unprotected targets. This results in effectively EMP-ing fighter craft a significant fraction of the time that contact is achieved.",Point Defense,,
PSE_thrall_launcher,WEAPON,"Fire salvos of heavy tungsten alloy masses strapped to high-delta rocket motors. Effective at pressuring most shield generators, and pairs well with high-explosive weaponry.",Anti Shield,,
PSE_helsing_flak_rifle,WEAPON,"A unique point defence weapon designed to take out fighter craft from long range with extreme prejudice, it can be a powerful area denial weapon in conjunction with dedicated PD processor AIs.",Anti Fighter,,
,,,,,
PSE_douglas,WEAPON,"Designed to be a counterpart to mid-range kinetic weapons, this autocannon can provide consistent anti-armor punch at a moderate flux cost.",Assault,,
PSE_hardlux,WEAPON,"A revolutionary design that fills a much-needed generalist role capable of heavily pressuring shield generators, at the cost of the major reactor drain needed to generate the exotic particles accelerated by this beamcannon.",Anti Shield,,
,,,,,
PSE_cascade_accelerator,WEAPON,"Unleashes bursts of self-sustaining dimensional projectiles incinerating unshielded electrical networks, but dealing minimal damage to armour.

The firing mechanism consists of dual quasi-magnetic accelerator rails with internal heavy ablative shielding that must be replaced between extended bursts. The protective shielding generally consists of ferrous organic compounds that can easily be applied with pressure nozzles, creating marbled layers of charred radioactive crusts and sticky composite, creating nightmare cleaning work for any maintenance crew. ",,,
PSE_parity_gun,WEAPON,"An awesome spinal energy accelerator gun mounted in the internal structure of most Leyland-class cruisers. When linked to an external drone array, a dimensional resonance is created that increases the destructive power of the weapon significantly.",,,
,,,,,
PSE_torrens,SHIP,"A quintessential logistics vessel, Torrens-class frigates find use in salvage expeditions and small trade convoys, providing easy operation in examining and detecting bodies of various sizes and compositions. Despite an anemic weapon loadout, compact drone tech can give it an edge in combat, but is not much use against anything bigger than itself.",,,
PSE_eyre,SHIP,"A steady and efficient cargo hauler providing cheap mass storage transit, and a favourite of commanders of smaller expeditions. Following convention with true cargo ships, the Eyre wields no special defensive armament, and is rarely seen outside of small trade convoys, being generally favoured less than larger and more economical vessels.",,,
PSE_cassius,SHIP,"Aggressively oriented and with attitude to match, a Cassius-class frigate can achieve fame on the battlefield with surgical strike capability enamoured by a quickly-recharging and effective movement subsystem.

A Cassius captain must be cool and collected while under fire, capable of waiting until opportune moments to slip between enemy firing arcs to provide critical strike or support, where a ship with greater tonnage would have been ensnared, unable to match the sudden bursts of speed at the disposal of the frigate. This lends the Cassius to be common at all levels of fleet size, especially shining in grand engagements, being both viable in close support roles to heavy cruisers and destroyers, or using a specialised strike package to deliver a Reaper-class torpedo into an overloaded enemy.",,,
PSE_kiruna,SHIP,"An advanced frigate hull with an unusually heavy armament, the Kiruna finds use in elite PEC navy fleets, valued for its swarm of PD defence drones and strike capability.

Inspired, in part, by designs from the late Expansion Epoch, advances in proprietary Delta-level sub-sentient AI technology in PEC naval integration allows for the deployment of a greater number of independent PD laser wielding drones, without sacrificing critical combat properties such as sub-light drive capability or shield performance.

When the effectiveness of the Kiruna-class frigate was demonstrated in an annual war game event, the design team was subsequently poached by a rival corporation, resulting in the successful development of the Tempest-class attack frigate, installing variable combat-rated capacitors in the place of PEC-owned drone technologies.",,,
,,,,,
PSE_denmark,SHIP,"The Denmark is a rugged heavy destroyer, trading more conventional armament for a suite of multirole defence drones. A strong ship in capable hands, the innate suppressive power of the Deuces-class defence drone is useful in both the line of battle and as a valuable member of faster task forces.

The inner engine voids are placed to allow easy reactor switching when power is redirected towards the energy beam generated in attack formation mode. This has the dual side effect of making engines more resilient towards EMP-based strike weapons such as the popular Salamander-class missile, but led to the Denmark's development of a reputation amongst Navy personnel as ""a bit of a barge-arse"", with the rear superstructures that house drone manufactories and energy transmission links ballooning outwards into the distinctive shape.

Despite the on-paper disadvantage of lacking raw firepower in weapon mounting opportunities, the Denmark finds constant use in PEC Navy doctrine, with an efficient logistics  operation schema and using mostly common drone parts and sub-sentient AI tech, easily manufactured from conventional supply components.",,,
PSE_richmond,SHIP,"The Richmond-class destroyer is found in most system defence fleets and task forces, featuring a strong all-round weaponry package and no significant drawbacks. 

Designed by the same maverick team as the Cassius-class frigate, using an up-scaled version of its boson-duplication velocity booster, a Richmond can quickly exit an engagement as fast as it can enter one, providing an astute captain the potential to provide mobile firepower on the battlefield, with the capability to disengage from an unfavourable situation.

All hulls come equipped with dual Burrows-class drones wielding short range EMP emitters, but in a conventional hull-specific LPC format, due to the difficulty of manufacturing the rare components necessary for EMP arc generation, requiring a carrier-derived miniforge to convert supply feedstocks to the necessary components.",,,
PSE_armstrong,SHIP,"A flexible carrier craft with a glass jaw capable of punching far above its weight. A single fighter complement provides it with additional tactical options, however the additional autoforge infrastructure compresses internal compartments well below standard sizes, hampering the ability of the crew to maintain nominal combat operation.

Despite initial enthusiasm for the design from the various engineering bureaus, the main flaw of the project laid in the complete inability for human crew operators to undertake critical maintenance tasks common on most conventional ships due to the cramped nature of the internal decking, as well as a lack of convenient access passages. As a result, the project blew out of budget in an attempt to automate repairs with specialised utility drones. While the review sheets submitted to Domain AI policing boards claimed that these drones were merely based on classical neural networks, there exists rumours of Armstrongs still in service for hundreds of years that have had to negotiate bargaining agreements and intranet privileges for their automated crews.",,,
,,,,,
PSE_serrano,SHIP,"Tough, immovable, and armed to the teeth, the Serrano is a constant dominating force on the battlefield, providing a key anchor point from which more strike-oriented hulls can stage temporary engagements.

Utilising the same multirole autonomous suite as the Denmark, but with a lesser reliance on engine performance, many experienced officers are more inclined to find use of the long-range high intensity laser derivative, as an unrelenting source of high-explosive damage, riveted through with a barrage of heavy kinetics. Despite weaker armour than similar cruisers of its weight class, the Serrano shines in its ability to combine the innately strong PD performance of its Deuces-class drone package with onboard PD solutions, providing a volume of missile denial firepower comparable to some battlecruisers.",,,
PSE_leyland,SHIP,"Swift and versatile, the Leyland is a dream to command, equipped with an efficient shield generator, an advanced multirole drone system, and the weapon suite of a hull at the apex of its class. This is especially complemented by the bulky Parity Destabiliser gun, exploiting sub-quantum particle effects poorly understood by the engineers of this age, to provide an effective, long-range artillery role to pressure retreating ships.

The Leyland was among the most recent of Pearson Exotronics R&D designs, and underwent discreet testing at the Cydonian military facilities, and was instrumental in fending off a Tri-Tachyon bombardment force, as the designated captain was able to utilise the highly flux-efficient ballistic weaponry options to gain an advantage against the energy weapons fielded by the malignant adversaries",,,
PSE_penrith,SHIP,"A starfleet mainstay that can dictate the terms of a battle by providing both strong offensive and defensive bonuses to allied fightercraft. The integral drone system is well-equipped to ensure the area around this ship remains clear of enemy contacts.

Among the oldest of hull patterns in the coveted Corporate engineering archives, the Penrith was designed for the brute purpose of ensuring local fighter superiority at all costs. Independent frontier worlds were often licensed stripped-down civilian models fitted with high-penetration remote geological surveying automata as a means to efficiently capture and exploit asteroid resources. Unbeknownst to them, however the primary purpose of this program was for embedded software to use this opportunity to develop AI models imitating the legendary skill of the rockhoppers operating the drone equipment.",,,
,,,,,
PSE_kingston,SHIP,"A testament to the scale of the wars of a bygone era, the Kingston is aptly named as the most supreme of Pearson Exotronics Corporation Navy vessels, matching heavy firepower and variable weapon mounting with advanced drone-based shield technology.

Developed as an answer to the Paragon-class fielded by rival corporation Tri-Tachyon, it was decided that the costs of acquiring the necessary permissions and licenses from high authorities of the Old Domain to design and manufacture a truly gigantic battleship were outweighed by the advantages of having capital fleet anchors  capable of enduring volleys of long-range plasma fire. This was achieved through espionage and illegal acquisition of rival corporate assets such that the most advanced shield technologies available to Domain militaries were compacted such that the shield drones created to carry these wide ranging shields could only be manufactured in combat by unique patterned nanoforges integral to the Kingston.",,,
,,,,,
PSE_rhys,SHIP,"A versatile attack fighter, equipped with a shell of heavy armour and a suite of suppressive weapons, ideal for supporting an attack formation. The integral kinetic railgun is particularly effective at applying heavy pressure to shields.",,,
PSE_carlton,SHIP,"Fast and deadly, the Carlton will disable and neutralise enemy targets through the use of a standard miniaturised Swarmer SRM launcher, and an effective EMP burst beam that can disable engines as well as reliably intercepting missiles.",,,
PSE_hale,SHIP,"A bomber designed for use in modular drone hangars, the Hale equips cheap Hammer-attern torpedoes for strong anti-ship strike capability, with a front shield that guarantees payload delivery in the absence of sufficient point defence coverage.",,,
PSE_drone_civilian,SHIP,A slow civilian drone equipped with a low-yield flak system and an infrared pulse laser. Useful as a distraction and mild PD support.,,,
PSE_drone2,SHIP,A drone built around an EMP emitter core and a directional shield generator. Fast and offers a powerful anti-missile and anti-fighter solution,,,
,,,,,
PSE_Corona,SHIP_SYSTEM,Launches drones programmed to cycle through two holding patterns; a PD defence formation and a focused attack formation.,,,
PSE_Bastion,SHIP_SYSTEM,"Launches four PD drones programmed to cycle through two holding patterns; a cardinal angle facing formation, and a focused front facing formation.",,,
PSE_Shroud,SHIP_SYSTEM,"Continually launches up to five unique shield drones in two holding patterns; a slowly orbiting circle cluster, and an unstable broadside oriented drive-boosting formation providing increased battleship maneuverability.",,,
PSE_pulseImpeller,SHIP_SYSTEM,"Stores up to four quickly-regenerating charges of an instant force-applying mass acceleration system, providing quick burst maneuverability in combat.",,,
PSE_Vector,SHIP_SYSTEM,"Launches drones programmed to cycle through two holding patterns; a targeting formation that increases the damage of the Parity Destabiliser gun, and a magnetically clamped vector thruster mode.",,,
PSE_droneEMP,SHIP_SYSTEM,Generates weak EMP arcs that hit nearby missiles and ships. Regenerates charges quickly.,,,
PSE_Rift,SHIP_SYSTEM,Launches four support drones equipped with defensive ion cannons and a streaming ECCM buffer array buffing friendly missiles and fighters.,,,
PSE_Citadel,SHIP_SYSTEM,An arrangement of four defence drones equipped with long-range flak rifles that can be arranged into a defensive frontal shield wall.,,,
PSE_ghostSkimmer,SHIP_SYSTEM,A reinterpretation of a conventional phase skimmer that shortens the effective range while increasing the rate at which the ship can perform short dimensional hops.,,,

pearson_exotronics,FACTION,"A lesser known megacorporation hailing from the late domain era, Pearson Exotronics were generally thought to have been founded as a conglomerate representing the interests of a number of formerly colonial worlds that had the infrastructure and good luck to develop original and inspired designs in the field of spaceborne engineering and robotics. Although finding competition in larger organisations such as the Tri-Tachyon Corporation and Eridani-Utopia, Pearson Exotronics was able to expand its influence into a number of sectors throughout its local region of colonised space, offering cheap transportation, habitation and defence contracting thanks to a number of significant breakthroughs in sub-sentient automation.

Pre-collapse, the PEC invested in building and entrenching a promising, postcolonial world formerly administrated by Domain authorities, in the hope of gaining a foothold in the Persean sector through offering competing technologies to otherwise monopolised services. When the gates fell, local leadership was quick to implement protocols assuming total disconnection from higher corporate command, taking steps to ensure self-sustainability and security. In the years post-collapse, Pearson Exotronics has survived wars and famine through tough civil doctrine and compulsary military service, building the foundation for a tough naval core with domestically-trained officers and personnel. The geographical location of the Corporation's home system as a buffer to the Hegemony worlds led to the two factions acting as mutual allies during the AI wars, but have subsequently soured from predatory trade practices. The Independent worlds of the sector are the Corporation's biggest customers, trading convoy protection and men for advanced technologies from  ancient military catacombs.",,,
PSE_new_caledonia,CUSTOM,"Starting recorded life as a promising Domain colonial project, primarily due to the human habitable climate and existing xenoflaura, the administration of this planet was purchased by the Pearson Exotronics Corporation some 100 cycles before the Collapse, as it offered a strong foothold for general economic profit and state-of-the-art R&D facilities. As such, the great planetary shield was constructed, generating a defensive envelope in committee colours, sustained by equatorial shield generators.

The second AI war resulted in its temporary subjugation, as a force of drone warships penetrated the defences and bombarded the planet, along with releasing numerous cyber-warfare routines, resulting in seemingly permanent damage to the black-box workings of the shield technology, with inexplicable failures causing lengthy reconstruction of generators and power transmission systems. Meanwhile, the released AI consciousnesses remain elusive to authorities, but in recent memory have remained ominously absent.",,,
