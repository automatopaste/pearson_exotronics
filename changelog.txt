========v0.5.3========
-fixed Iuchar planet name mismatch
-balanced fleet point values
-fixed commissioned crews hullmod being available in refit
-commission bonus hullmod now provides flat armour bonus to ships
-fixed shroud shipsystem AI
-fixed Adelaide not having farmland
-changed drone targeting AI scripts, now will not attempt to shoot over the ship when prioritising enemy ships, but can
track missiles and fighters if they move behind
-corona shipsystem AI tweaked to be less afraid of keeping the beam active in the presence of certain missiles, should
ignore dumb-fire missiles that will not collide
-fixed zero flux speed boost on corona ships permanently disabling
-buffed kiruna, is now a viable frigate for its cost, comparable to tempest
    -max speed 135 -> 160
    -removed delicate machinery hullmod
-fleet point values adjusted to align with vanilla
-hammond inbuilt burrows drone wing now uses interceptor AI instead of support, is much more aggressive and useful
-general drone AI will now prioritise selecting targeted ship when searching for enemy ships to target
-variant tweaks
-added compatibility for "industrial evolution" ship reverse-engineering and duplication features
-fixed pressing F in combat cycling drone systems of all ai ships (oops)
-friendly fire detection prevents drones from firing longer ranged weapons over friendly ships for cheese avoidance
========v0.5.2========
-tweaked drone shroud shipsystem AI
-reduced kingston shield drone flux capacity 7500 -> 6000
-added two new missions with randomly generated fleets for fun and testing
    -Random vs. Pearson
    -Pearson vs. Random
-added new console command "SpawnPearsonContent" that will run the campaign generation scripts normally run on starting
a new game, used to add the faction to an existing save. will still be incompatible with saves with previous versions if
an update is not save compatible.
-variant tweaks

    unstable broadside-oriented shielded drive field boost

    -versatile broadside/front focused loadouts possible with AI tested to be competent at both, including asymmetry
        -live out your depraved converging cyclone reaper fantasies
    -actually spawns in campaign (faction updated to know ship variants)
-tweaks and improvements to drone system AI
    -drone corona ships are now less inclined to play drone roulette with endless cycling
    -AI controlled ships will now be able to cycle through system when remaining drone count is zero
-updated pulse impeller shipsystem, available on cassius-class frigates and richmond-class destroyers

    forgot that it wasn't unique to the destroyer
-added version checker support
-updated mission logo, variants
-added unused modular drone clamping and maneuvering thruster shipsystem, going to be equipped on a cruiser coming to a
beta near you sometime soon
